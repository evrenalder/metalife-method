## Updated MetaLife refence vault to version 1.3.2

- Upgraded [Templater plugin](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater) to version 2.1.0
- Removed `0 Home/Home` file and `0 Home` folder in favor of `README` at root so that the same general information is also provided on the [project's GitHub landing page](https://github.com/evrenalder/metalife-method).
- Installed [Homepage plugin](https://github.com/mirnovov/obsidian-homepage) and configured it to launch README on startup
- Moved Changelog from `0 Home/` to `3 Resources/MetaLife MethodÂ®`
- Disabled "Use Wikilinks" in Settings > Files and links
	- One can still use double-brackets to create internal links, but the format written follows the markdown standard
- Added the [Journal Archive](Journal%20Archive.md) folder under `4 Archive`.
