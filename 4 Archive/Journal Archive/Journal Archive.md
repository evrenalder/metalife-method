# Journal Archive

> [!INFO]
> When a year passes, the year's folder is moved from the `2 Areas/Journal/` folder to here, under the `4 Archive/Journal Archive` folder. This keeps the active journal clean and easy to work in while ensuring that old journal entries remain in the vaultâ€”browsable and searchable.
